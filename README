## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory.


3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content (modify as needed):

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_mysql_root_password
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password



4. Build and run the app using Docker Compose:

5. The app should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Endpoints
- `POST /identify`: The endpoint for identifying contacts.

## Notes
- Make sure to replace `your_mysql_root_password`, `your_mysql_user`, and `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL credentials in the `.env` file and `docker-compose.yml`.

- If you need to change the port on which the app listens, update the `EXPOSE` statement in the `Dockerfile` and the port mapping in the `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.
